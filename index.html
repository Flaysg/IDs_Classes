this will later be fixed with flexbox -->

      <!-- img tags are self-closing, they dont need 2 tags, it also needs two attributes, src and alt text. -->
      <!-- here you can either choose to use the img tag to style up, however im not confident this will be the only image so we'll use a CLASS instead -->
      <!-- alternatively, you can add ID's to our elements and grab them in our css thanks to the # , ID's are unique, 
      each element can have only one ID and each page cna only have one element with that ID  -->
      <!-- classes are not unique, you can use the same class on multiple elements, can also use multiple classes on an element -->
      <!-- elements can have both a CLASS and an ID  -->
